# Field Technicians Guide

## Your Role in the CMMS System

As a Field Technician, you are the eyes and hands of our maintenance operation. You execute the work orders automatically generated by the system, provide critical feedback on equipment condition, and serve as the first line of defense against equipment failures.

## 🎯 Key Responsibilities

- **Complete assigned work orders** generated by the Equipment Strategy system
- **Report equipment conditions** and anomalies during inspections
- **Document findings accurately** to feed data back into the system
- **Respond to urgent alerts** and process monitoring notifications
- **Maintain safety standards** in all maintenance activities

## 📅 Daily Workflow

### Start of Shift (10-15 minutes)
1. **Check Task Dashboard** - Review assigned work orders for the day
2. **Priority Review** - Identify any HIGH or CRITICAL priority tasks
3. **Resource Check** - Verify tools, parts, and permits are available
4. **Safety Brief** - Review specific safety requirements for assigned tasks

### During Shift
- **Execute work orders** in priority sequence
- **Document observations** immediately after each task
- **Report issues** that require engineering attention
- **Update task status** as work progresses

### End of Shift (10 minutes)
- **Complete pending documentation** for finished work orders
- **Update status** on any incomplete tasks
- **Report equipment concerns** discovered during the day
- **Prepare handoff** for next shift if needed

## 🔧 Core Functions

### 1. Work Order Management

#### Accessing Your Daily Tasks

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to **Task Management** dashboard
2. View your assigned work orders organized by:
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
   - **Due Date**: Overdue → Today → This Week
   - **Equipment**: Grouped by area/system
   - **Type**: Inspection → Preventive → Corrective

**Task Information Available**:
```
Work Order: WO-2025-0145
Equipment: EQ006 - Pump 1 (Cooling System)
Task: Weekly pump inspection and lubrication
Priority: MEDIUM
Estimated Time: 2.0 hours
Due Date: July 10, 2025
Assigned To: You
Status: SCHEDULED

Required:
- PPE: Hard hat, safety glasses, hearing protection
- Tools: Vibration meter, grease gun, flashlight
- Skills: Basic mechanical
- Permits: None required
```

#### Understanding Priority Levels

| Priority | Response Time | Characteristics | Example |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate | Safety risk, production impact | Emergency shutdown equipment |
| **HIGH** | Within 4 hours | Equipment degradation, compliance | High temperature alert response |
| **MEDIUM** | Within 24 hours | Routine preventive maintenance | Weekly inspections |
| **LOW** | Within 72 hours | Optimization, minor issues | Housekeeping, minor repairs |

### 2. Executing Work Orders

#### Pre-Work Preparation

**Safety First**:
1. **Review safety requirements** listed in work order
2. **Check permit requirements** (confined space, hot work, etc.)
3. **Verify PPE availability** and condition
4. **Confirm lockout/tagout procedures** if required

**Resource Verification**:
1. **Tools and instruments** - Check calibration dates
2. **Spare parts** - Verify availability in storeroom
3. **Consumables** - Oil, grease, filters, gaskets
4. **Documentation** - Procedures, drawings, manufacturer instructions

#### Task Execution Best Practices

**During Inspection Tasks**:
```
□ Follow systematic inspection sequence
□ Use all senses - look, listen, feel, smell
□ Take photos of unusual conditions
□ Measure and record specified parameters
□ Compare current vs. previous readings
□ Note any changes from normal operation
```

**Documentation Requirements**:
- **Condition Found**: Detailed description of current state
- **Actions Taken**: Specific work performed
- **Measurements**: All readings and observations
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for follow-up work
- **Next Due Date**: When applicable

**Example Good Documentation**:
```
Equipment: EQ006 - Cooling System Pump
Task: Weekly Inspection

Condition Found:
- Bearing temperature: 65°C (normal: 45-55°C)
- Unusual vibration at motor end
- Slight oil seepage at bearing housing
- Pump performance normal (flow/pressure OK)

Actions Taken:
- Added 200ml lubricating oil to bearing
- Checked alignment - within spec
- Cleaned oil seepage area
- Scheduled vibration analysis

Recommendations:
- Monitor bearing temperature daily
- Consider bearing replacement within 30 days
- Investigate root cause of oil seepage
```

### 3. Equipment Condition Reporting

#### What to Look For

**Visual Inspection Checklist**:
- **Leaks**: Oil, water, gas, steam
- **Wear**: Belts, chains, couplings
- **Corrosion**: Rust, oxidation, chemical attack
- **Damage**: Cracks, breaks, deformation
- **Cleanliness**: Debris, contamination, buildup
- **Security**: Loose bolts, missing guards, alignment

**Performance Indicators**:
- **Temperatures**: Above/below normal ranges
- **Pressures**: System and component pressures
- **Flows**: Rates and consistency
- **Vibrations**: Unusual levels or patterns
- **Sounds**: Changes from normal operation
- **Electrical**: Current draw, voltage levels

#### When to Escalate Issues

**Immediate Escalation** (Call supervisor immediately):
- **Safety hazards**: Gas leaks, electrical exposure, structural damage
- **Environmental risks**: Spills, emissions, containment failures
- **Production threats**: Equipment about to fail, process deviations
- **Security issues**: Missing equipment, unauthorized access

**Routine Escalation** (Document and report same day):
- **Performance degradation**: Efficiency loss, increased wear
- **Maintenance needs**: Additional work required beyond current scope
- **Parts requirements**: Components need replacement soon
- **Procedure issues**: Work instructions unclear or outdated

### 4. Process Monitoring Integration

#### Understanding Process Alerts

Sometimes you'll receive notifications that process monitoring has detected unusual conditions:

```
PROCESS ALERT
Equipment: EQ006 - Pump 1
Parameter: Temperature
Current: 85°C | Normal: 60-80°C
System Request: Additional inspection required
Your Action: Perform detailed bearing inspection
Timeline: Within 4 hours
```

**Your Response**:
1. **Prioritize this task** - treat as HIGH priority
2. **Gather appropriate tools** - temperature gun, vibration meter
3. **Perform thorough inspection** - focus on the alerted parameter
4. **Document findings carefully** - this data affects future maintenance frequency
5. **Report results immediately** - system uses this to optimize maintenance

#### Data Collection for Process Monitoring

The system learns from your observations to improve automatic task generation:

**Key Data Points**:
- **Parameter readings**: Temperatures, pressures, flows
- **Trending information**: "Getting worse" vs "Stable" vs "Improving"
- **Correlation observations**: "High temperature coincides with increased vibration"
- **Environmental factors**: "Performance worse in hot weather"
