# Maintenance Engineers Guide

## Your Role in the CMMS System

As a Maintenance Engineer, you are the technical decision-maker who ensures our maintenance strategies are optimized for safety, reliability, and efficiency. You'll work with Equipment Strategies, Risk Assessments, and Process Monitoring to create proactive maintenance programs.

## üéØ Key Responsibilities

- **Create and maintain Equipment Strategies** that drive automatic task generation
- **Conduct and approve Risk Assessments** (FMEA) to prioritize maintenance activities
- **Review and approve process-triggered changes** to maintenance frequency
- **Analyze equipment performance** and optimize maintenance approaches
- **Ensure compliance** with safety and regulatory requirements

## üìÖ Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (15-20 minutes)
1. **Check Dashboard** - Review overnight alerts and critical notifications
2. **Process Monitoring Review** - Check for any process-triggered ES changes
3. **Risk Assessment Queue** - Review pending risk assessments requiring approval
4. **Task Generation Status** - Verify automatic task creation is functioning properly

### Throughout the Day
- **Respond to Notifications** - Address ES change requests within 4 hours
- **Technical Consultations** - Support field technicians with complex issues
- **Data Analysis** - Review equipment performance trends

### End of Day (10 minutes)
- **Update pending reviews** - Ensure all critical items are addressed
- **Plan tomorrow's priorities** - Review upcoming scheduled assessments

## üîß Core Functions

### 1. Equipment Strategy Management

#### Creating a New Equipment Strategy

**When to create**:
- New equipment installation
- Equipment modification or upgrade
- Change in operating conditions
- Poor performance with existing strategy

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to **Task Management** ‚Üí **Generate Tasks**
2. Click **"Create New Strategy"**
3. Fill out strategy details:
   ```
   Equipment: [Select from dropdown]
   Strategy Type: Preventive/Predictive/Condition-Based
   Frequency: Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly
   Task Description: [Detailed work instructions]
   Required Skills: Basic/Intermediate/Expert
   Estimated Duration: [Hours]
   Tools Required: [List specific tools]
   Safety Requirements: [PPE and safety procedures]
   ```
4. Set priority level based on equipment criticality
5. **Save and Activate**

**Best Practices**:
- Base frequency on manufacturer recommendations and experience
- Include clear, actionable task descriptions
- Specify required competencies and tools
- Consider seasonal or operational variations

#### Modifying Existing Strategies

**Triggers for modification**:
- Process monitoring alerts suggesting frequency changes
- Risk assessment recommendations
- Performance data analysis
- Regulatory requirement changes

**Modification Process**:
1. Access **Equipment Strategy** from the main dashboard
2. Select equipment and view current strategy
3. Review **Change History** to understand previous modifications
4. Make adjustments to:
   - Frequency (increase/decrease based on data)
   - Scope (add/remove inspection points)
   - Procedures (update based on lessons learned)
5. Document **Justification** for changes
6. **Approve and implement**

### 2. Risk Assessment (FMEA) Management

#### Conducting Risk Assessments

**When required**:
- Scheduled annual/semi-annual reviews
- Process monitoring triggers (HIGH/CRITICAL alerts)
- After equipment modifications
- Following significant incidents

**FMEA Process**:

**Step 1: System Review**
```
Navigate to: Risk Assessment ‚Üí System Overview
Select: Target system or equipment group
Review: Current failure modes and risk scenarios
```

**Step 2: Failure Mode Analysis**
```
For each failure mode, evaluate:
- Severity (1-10): Impact on safety, environment, production
- Occurrence (1-10): Likelihood of failure happening
- Detection (1-10): Ability to detect before failure occurs
- RPN = Severity √ó Occurrence √ó Detection
```

**Step 3: Risk Scenario Evaluation**
```
Risk Matrix Assessment (5√ó5):
- Likelihood: Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain
- Consequence: Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic
- Risk Level: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXTREME
```

**Step 4: Mitigation Recommendations**
```
High RPN (>100) or HIGH/EXTREME risk requires:
- Immediate action items
- ES frequency adjustments
- Additional controls or procedures
- Follow-up review schedule
```

#### Risk Assessment Decision Matrix

| RPN Score | Risk Level | Action Required | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| >200 | Critical | Immediate ES change + additional controls | 24 hours |
| 125-200 | High | ES frequency increase + monitoring | 72 hours |
| 75-125 | Medium | Consider ES adjustments | 1 week |
| <75 | Low | Continue current strategy | Next review |

### 3. Process Monitoring Response

#### Understanding Process Alerts

**Alert Types**:
- **LIMIT_EXCEEDED**: Parameter outside normal operating range
- **DEVIATION**: Significant change from baseline values
- **TREND**: Gradual drift indicating developing problem

**Response Process**:

**1. Alert Receipt**
```
System sends notification:
"Process Alert: TI-101-01 Temperature exceeded threshold
Current: 85.5¬∞C | Normal: 60-80¬∞C
Equipment: EQ006 (Pump 1)
System: Cooling System"
```

**2. Technical Assessment**
- Review historical data trends
- Check related process parameters
- Consult with operations team
- Evaluate impact on equipment health

**3. Decision Making**
```
Options:
‚ñ° Approve ES frequency increase (recommended)
‚ñ° Reject change (provide justification)
‚ñ° Modify alternative parameters
‚ñ° Request additional investigation
```

**4. Implementation**
- Update Equipment Strategy if approved
- Document decision rationale
- Monitor effectiveness of changes

#### Integration with Risk Assessment

When process alerts occur:
1. **Automatic trigger**: System checks if risk review is needed
2. **Risk evaluation**: Assess if failure mode probabilities changed
3. **Update requirements**: Modify risk scores if necessary
4. **ES adjustment**: Implement recommended frequency changes

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Individual Performance Metrics
- **Response Time to Alerts**: Target <4 hours
- **Risk Assessment Completion**: Target <72 hours
- **ES Optimization Success**: Measure equipment reliability improvement
- **Process Alert Resolution**: Track accuracy of decisions

### System Performance Monitoring
- **Equipment Availability**: Target >95%
- **Preventive vs Reactive Ratio**: Target 70:30
- **Cost per Maintenance Hour**: Track efficiency improvements
- **Safety Incidents**: Target zero maintenance-related incidents

## üß† Decision-Making Guidelines

### When to Increase Maintenance Frequency

**Process-driven triggers**:
- Consistent parameter deviations >20% from normal
- Multiple alerts within 30-day period
- Trending toward critical limits

**Risk-driven triggers**:
- RPN increase >50 points
- New HIGH or EXTREME risk scenarios
- Safety or environmental impact potential

### When to Decrease Maintenance Frequency

**Conditions**:
- 6+ months of stable operation
- No process alerts or failures
- Cost-benefit analysis supports reduction
- Risk assessment confirms acceptable levels

**Process**:
1. Document stable performance period
2. Conduct risk re-assessment
3. Pilot reduced frequency on selected equipment
4. Monitor closely for 3 months
5. Implement broadly if successful

### Balancing Competing Priorities

**Cost vs Risk**:
- Use RPN scores to quantify risk reduction value
- Calculate maintenance cost per failure prevented
- Consider regulatory and safety requirements

**Resources vs Coverage**:
- Prioritize critical equipment (HIGH criticality)
- Use predictive maintenance where applicable
- Leverage condition-based strategies for stable equipment

- **Regulatory compliance** review and updates

## üí° Best Practices

### Equipment Strategy Development
- **Start conservative** - you can always reduce frequency later
- **Use data-driven decisions** - avoid guesswork
- **Consider total cost of ownership** - not just maintenance cost
- **Plan for variability** - seasonal, operational, aging effects

### Risk Assessment Excellence
- **Involve operators** - they know equipment best
- **Use historical data** - failures, near-misses, repairs
- **Think systematically** - consider interactions and dependencies
- **Update regularly** - conditions and knowledge change

### Process Integration
- **Trust the system** - but verify with engineering judgment
- **Respond promptly** - delays reduce system effectiveness
- **Document decisions** - create institutional knowledge
- **Communicate changes** - keep team informed
