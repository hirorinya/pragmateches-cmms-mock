## 🔧 Core Functions

### 1. Work Order Management and Prioritization

#### Understanding System Prioritization

The CMMS automatically prioritizes work orders based on:
- **Safety impact**: Life safety gets highest priority
- **Environmental risk**: Potential emissions or spills
- **Production impact**: Critical equipment downtime cost
- **Risk assessment scores**: RPN and risk level
- **Process monitoring alerts**: Real-time condition changes

**Your Override Authority**:
- **Emergency situations** - immediate reprioritization
- **Resource conflicts** - delay non-critical work
- **Production coordination** - align with operational needs
- **Regulatory deadlines** - compliance-driven scheduling

#### Daily Work Planning

**Morning Planning Process**:
1. **Review overnight alerts** and system-generated priorities
2. **Assess team capacity** - available hours, skills, tools
3. **Check resource availability** - parts, permits, support services
4. **Coordinate with operations** - production schedule impacts
5. **Assign work orders** considering individual strengths and development needs

**Example Planning Decision**:
```
Situation: Two HIGH priority work orders scheduled today
- EQ006 Pump inspection (2 hrs, requires vibration analysis)
- EQ009 Transformer oil sampling (1 hr, requires electrical permit)

Decision factors:
✓ Both technicians certified for electrical work
✓ Vibration analyzer available
✓ Operations can isolate transformer at 2 PM
✓ Pump can be inspected during operation

Plan:
09:00 - Smith starts pump inspection
10:00 - Johnson prepares transformer isolation
14:00 - Johnson performs transformer sampling
15:00 - Smith completes pump documentation
```

### 2. Approval Workflow Management

#### Equipment Strategy Change Approvals

**When you receive ES change requests**:
```
ES Change Request:
Equipment: EQ006 - Cooling Pump
Current Strategy: Monthly inspection
Recommended: Weekly inspection
Trigger: Process monitoring - high temperature alerts
Justification: 3 temperature excursions in 2 weeks
Impact: +6 hours/month workload
Approval Required By: Supervisor
Timeline: 24 hours
```

**Approval Decision Process**:
1. **Review technical justification** - is the recommendation sound?
2. **Assess resource impact** - can team handle increased workload?
3. **Check historical data** - is this a recurring issue?
4. **Consider alternatives** - temporary increase vs. permanent change?
5. **Make decision** and document rationale

**Approval Criteria**:
- **Approve if**: Clear technical justification, manageable resource impact
- **Approve with modifications**: Adjust frequency or scope as needed
- **Reject if**: Insufficient justification, resource constraints, better alternatives available
- **Defer if**: Need more information or engineering consultation

#### Risk Assessment Review

**High-Risk Scenarios Requiring Approval**:
```
Risk Assessment Alert:
System: Cooling System (SYS-001)
Risk Level: HIGH → EXTREME
Failure Mode: Pump bearing failure (RPN: 168 → 240)
Recommendation: Immediate ES frequency increase + condition monitoring
Resource Impact: +12 hours/month + vibration analysis equipment
Approval Required: Supervisor + Maintenance Engineer
```

**Review Process**:
1. **Safety assessment** - immediate hazards requiring action?
2. **Technical review** - consult with maintenance engineer
3. **Resource planning** - budget and schedule impact
4. **Risk tolerance** - acceptable level for business
5. **Implementation planning** - how to execute changes

### 3. Resource Management
