## üîß **SUGGESTED IMMEDIATE TESTS**

### 1. Test the Fixed Strategy Coverage Feature:
**Query:** `"The equipment belonging to SYS-001 carries a very high risk of tube blockage caused by fouling. Are all of them fully reflected in the Equipment Strategy?"`
**Expected:** Should show equipment strategy coverage analysis with risk highlighting

### 2. Test Cascade Analysis:
**Query:** `"What happens if TI-401 shows high temperature?"`  
**Expected:** Should show fouling detection cascade to TK-201

### 3. Test Specific Equipment:
**Query:** `"What are the risk factors for equipment HX-101?"`
**Expected:** Should show specific HX-101 risk assessments

### 4. Test System Analysis:
**Query:** `"How many risk scenarios do you have?"`
**Expected:** Should show risk scenario count and breakdown

### 5. Test Complex Decision Support:
**Query:** `"Should we shut down HX-200 for cleaning now?"`
**Expected:** Should provide decision analysis with risks and impacts

## üìä **PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS**

‚úÖ **Working Well:**
- Department performance analytics (perfect results)
