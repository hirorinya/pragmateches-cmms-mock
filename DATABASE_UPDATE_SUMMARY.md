# Database Update Summary - 2025-07-11

## Overview
The AI system testing revealed several gaps in the database that need to be filled to provide complete functionality.

## Updates Being Applied

### 1. Equipment Strategies (equipment_strategy)
**Issue:** "EQ005の緩和策の実施状況" returns "Equipment not found"
**Solution:** Adding maintenance strategies for all equipment
- 13 new equipment strategies
- Covers preventive maintenance, condition monitoring, calibration
- Assigns responsible departments (MAINTENANCE, REFINERY, INSTRUMENTATION, etc.)
- Sets proper frequencies (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, ANNUALLY)

### 2. Process Monitoring Instruments (process_parameters)
**Issue:** "TI-201 temperature increased" returns "Instrument not found"
**Solution:** Adding real process monitoring instruments
- 8 process parameters (TI-201, PI-101, FI-301, etc.)
- Temperature, pressure, flow, and level instruments
- Normal and critical operating ranges
- Links to actual equipment (HX-201, PU-100, TK-101, etc.)

### 3. Fouling Failure Modes (failure_modes)
**Issue:** Coverage analysis shows equipment without fouling risk coverage
**Solution:** Adding fouling-specific failure modes
- 6 new fouling failure modes
- Covers all equipment identified in coverage analysis
- Proper RPN scoring (severity × occurrence × detection)
- Impact assessments for safety, environmental, and production

### 4. Process Trigger Rules (process_trigger_rules)
**Issue:** No automated triggers for process deviations
**Solution:** Adding monitoring rules
- 4 process trigger rules
- High temperature, low pressure, low flow alarms
- Links to equipment strategies for automatic updates

### 5. Task Generation Logs (task_generation_log)
**Issue:** No implementation tracking for strategies
**Solution:** Adding task history and schedules
- Completed tasks for June/July 2025
- Scheduled upcoming tasks
- Proper task types (INSPECTION, CLEANING, OVERHAUL, CALIBRATION)

### 6. Equipment Risk Assessment Updates
**Issue:** Missing fouling risk assessments
**Solution:** Updating risk assessments
- Fouling risks for EQ005, EQ006, EQ013, EQ014
- Risk scores and mitigation measures
- Proper evaluation dates and responsible persons

## After Migration

### AI Queries That Will Now Work:

1. **Coverage Analysis** ✅
   - "Which equipment in SYS-001 are not reflected in ES for fouling blockage risk?"
   - Will now show equipment WITH fouling failure modes

2. **Mitigation Status** ✅
   - "EQ005の緩和策の実施状況は？"
   - Will show actual maintenance strategies and implementation status

3. **Process Impact Analysis** ✅
   - "If TI-201 temperature increased, which equipment would be affected?"
   - Will identify HX-201 and trigger appropriate actions

4. **Equipment Health Analysis** ✅
   - Real-time process data available
   - Trend analysis possible
   - Automatic ES updates based on process conditions

## Deployment Instructions

1. Apply the migration:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/20250711_complete_data_relationships.sql
```

2. Verify data:
```sql
-- Check equipment strategies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM equipment_strategy WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
-- Should return 13+

-- Check process parameters
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM process_parameters WHERE is_active = true;
-- Should return 8+

-- Check fouling failure modes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM failure_modes WHERE failure_mode LIKE '%fouling%' OR failure_mode LIKE '%汚れ%';
-- Should return 6+
```

3. Test AI queries again to confirm all working properly

## Expected Results

- All equipment will have proper maintenance strategies
- Process monitoring will detect TI-201, PI-101, etc.
- Fouling risk coverage will be complete
- Mitigation status queries will return real implementation data
- Process deviations will trigger appropriate ES updates
