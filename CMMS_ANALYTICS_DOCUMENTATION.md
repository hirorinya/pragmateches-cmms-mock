## Overview

This document describes the completed CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) enhanced analytics capabilities that provide advanced natural language query processing for complex maintenance scenarios.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced AI Service (`src/services/enhanced-ai-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Advanced natural language understanding for CMMS queries
- **Key Features**:
  - Intent classification with pattern matching
  - Hybrid Text-to-SQL and Enhanced AI routing
  - Complex query support for 5 major analytics categories
  - Multi-language support (English/Japanese)

#### 2. Database Schema Enhancements

## Query Processing Logic

### Intent Detection Algorithm

1. **Pattern Matching**: Uses regex patterns to identify query intent
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels to intent matches
3. **Multi-language Support**: Handles both English and Japanese patterns
4. **Context Awareness**: Considers query context for better accuracy

### Routing Decision Logic

```typescript
// Simplified routing logic
if (shouldUseTextToSQL(query)) {
  // Route to OpenAI Text-to-SQL for complex queries
  return await textToSQLService.processQuery(query)
} else {
  // Route to Enhanced AI for pattern-based queries
  return await this.processQuery(query)
}
```

### Text-to-SQL vs Enhanced AI Routing

**Text-to-SQL Used For**:
- Complex analytical queries with aggregations
- Multi-table join requirements
- Time-based trend analysis
- Numerical computations

**Enhanced AI Used For**:
- Equipment strategy coverage analysis
- Department performance queries
- Instrumentation cascade analysis
- Specific equipment status queries
